          John Davison Rockefeller Sr. (July 8, 1839 – May 23, 1937) was an
          American business magnate and philanthropist. He has been widely
          considered the wealthiest American of all time[1][2] and the richest
          person in modern history.[3][4] Rockefeller was born into a large
          family in Upstate New York that moved several times before eventually
          settling in Cleveland. He became an assistant bookkeeper at age 16 and
          went into several business partnerships beginning at age 20,
          concentrating his business on oil refining. Rockefeller founded the
          Standard Oil Company in 1870. He ran it until 1897 and remained its
          largest shareholder.

            <p>
              <i>July 8, 1839</i> - John Davison Rockefeller is born in
              Richford, New York, the second of six children.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1859</i> - After dropping out of high school, taking one
              business class at Folsom Mercantile College, and working as a
              bookkeeper, Rockefeller establishes his first business, which
              supplies goods such as hay, grain, and meats.
            </p>

          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1863–65</i> - Rockefeller builds his first oil refinery, near
              Cleveland. Within two years it is the largest refinery in the
              area.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1870–72</i> - Rockefeller and a few associates, a group that
              includes American financier Henry M. Flagler, incorporate the
              Standard Oil Company (Ohio). Because of Rockefeller’s emphasis on
              economical operations, Standard prospers and begins to buy out its
              competitors until, by 1872, it controls nearly all the refineries
              in Cleveland.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1881–82</i> - Rockefeller and his associates place the stock of
              Standard of Ohio and its affiliates in other states under the
              control of a board of trustees, with Rockefeller at the head. They
              thus establish the first major U.S. “trust,” a type of business
              monopoly. By 1882 Standard Oil has a near monopoly on the oil
              business in the United States.

            <p>
              <i>1890</i> - The U.S. Congress passes the Sherman Antitrust Act,

            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1892</i> - The Ohio Supreme Court rules that the Standard Oil
              Trust is a monopoly, which violates state antitrust law.
              Rockefeller sidesteps the decision by dissolving the trust and
              transferring its properties to companies in other states.

              Trust are brought back together in a holding company, Standard Oil
              Company (New Jersey).

          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              <i>1902–04</i> - McClure’s Magazine publishes installments of

              (New Jersey) in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act and
              therefore illegal. It is ordered to divest itself of its major
              holdings—33 companies in all.
